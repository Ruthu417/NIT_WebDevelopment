DataTypes in JAVASCRIPT
Data type declares the type of the data stored in var/let/const
JS offers 8 datatypes
2 types
	1. Primitive and
		- built in datatypes and represents the single value so
		that are not mutable(immutable)
			Number,String,Undefined,Boolean,Null,BigInt,Symbol,
		
	2. Non-primitive
		also known as reference types are objects and derived datatypes
		they can store multiple values or entities
			Objects,Arrays
			
	3. Conditionals
		if,else,else if 
		switch
		
	4. Loops (5 types)
		for - loops through a block of code a number of times
		for/in - loops through the properties of an object
		for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object 
			- works based on the browser support
		while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
		do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
		
		
	5. Strings
		Anything that enclosed in the quotation considered as as string
		it is a datatype and immutable in nature
		String methods
		str.concat()
		str.substr()
		str.slice()
		str.sub()
		str.replace()
		str.charAt()
		str.replaceAll()
		str.repeat()
		str.toUpperCase()
		str.toLowerCase()
		str.split()
		
		
	6. Operators
		- a thing which performs any operation on operands(variable)
		- EX:a+b; + is the op'r performs summation op'n on a and b
			+,-,*,/,//,^,% = arithmetic op'rs
			boolean ,
			comparisional/relational
				- <,<=,>,>= (can able to operate statements
			bitwise 
				- performing the op'n on each bit of the digit
					-,||(pipe),&&,<<,>> ,++,--,
			assignment op'rs
				- assigning the value
				let x=10;
				x=x+1; +=,-=
				
	7 Objects in JAVASCRIPT
		Any thing that has some property and physical existance
		- Ex:chair
		Class is the blueprint of the object
			attributes:features/properties of the object
			methods:functionality:the purpose
